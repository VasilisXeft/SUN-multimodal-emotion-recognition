# SUN-multimodal-emotion-recognition
This repository contains the code of the multimodal emotion recognition of the SUN project.

The code is based on the EmotiBit wearable sensor. The folder "Models" contains the trained machine-learning models for valence and arousal prediction. The file "paths_config.py" needs to be changed accordingly.
